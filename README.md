# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# How to Use It - run the following commands: 
## 1. Get the concert information about an artis or a band: 

#### This use Bands in Town Artist Events API  for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:


```
 
   * node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>   
    
```

#### Result: 

```
    -  Name of the venue
    -  Venue location
    -  Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")
```

#### Use Case:

```
> node liri.js concert-this pink

 ============Concerts Information =========
======= pink=======
Name of the venue: P!NK: BEAUTIFUL TRAUMA WORLD TOUR
Location: United States, Sunrise
Date of the Event: 03/01/2019
=====================
```


## 2. Show information about a song: 

#### This utilize the node-spotify-api package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API. 

#### Do the following in order to be able to run the program:
Make a JavaScript file named keys.js.

Inside keys.js your file will look like this:

```
console.log('this is loaded');

exports.spotify = {
  id: process.env.SPOTIFY_ID,
  secret: process.env.SPOTIFY_SECRET
};
```
Next, create a file named .env, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:

```
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
```

This file will be used by the dotenv package to set what are known as environment variables to the global process.env object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github â€” keeping our API key information private.


```
 
   * node liri.js spotify-this-song <name_of_the_song>   
    
```

#### Result: 

```
  - Artist(s)
  - The song's name
